# learn-backend-mini-projects

This is a repository for mini projects to help junior engineers get hands-on exposure to important backend software development skills and tools. Right now, these are the topics that these projects include:

- Implementing Python CLIs using Click
- Working with S3, Minio, and Docker in Python
- Writing SQL queries against SQLite databases in Python

Projects are intended to be varying degrees of complexity; contain instructions that are compatible with local setups on Linux, Mac, or Windows; and not require any accounts on web platforms or money. I hope to eventually expand this repository over time to include projects that provide experience with Golang, testing, REST APIs, other AWS services, and perhaps more advanced SQL and Docker... we'll see what I'm able to put together as the mood strikes / what my communities are interested in.

To get started, check out the directories for the individual projects, fork/clone/download the codebase however you like, and follow the project READMEs. Happy coding!
