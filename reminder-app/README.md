# reminder-app

**NOTE: This project is completely NOT READY**

## TODOs for Max

- [ ] Setup LocalStack SQS
- [ ] Dockerized MySQL
- [ ] Dockerize Go app
- [ ] Start a Makefile
- [ ] Flesh out base implementation some more
- [ ] Introduce interfaces + mocks + testing (could be a follow-up project; could try to go more TDD upfront)
- [ ] More CURL examples
- [ ] Boilerplate for integrating with SQS
- [ ] Boilerplate for integrating with MySQL
- [ ] Write up READMEs
    - [ ] At minimum: goals, challenges, resources
    - [ ] Preferably: separate README per Go package explaining key concepts, pointing to tutorials/examples as needed, and the remaining project tasks for that package
- [ ] Probably want to use a separate Github repo, I guess? ðŸ¦¥
- [ ] Try my best to make this project OS agnostic
